# MetaIoT-Blockchain

MetaIoT-Blockchain is an upcoming project that helps developers prototype and publish sensor-driven (dApps) in augmented reality using Mobile Native, AWS, Hyperledger and Ethereum.

This project includes a Starter Project (Planter AI - CrossPlatform Apps) with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, AWS and Hyperledger, and Ethereum. It will allow developers to create mobile dApps with sensors, and uploaded to Snapcraft.io, The App Store, and Google Play using Augmented Reality (AR), AWS (Amazon Web Server & Services) and Hyperledger & Ethereum.
