# MetaIoT-Blockchain

MetaIoT-Blockchain is an upcoming project that helps developers prototype and publish sensor-driven (dApps) in augmented reality using Mobile Native, AWS, (Hyperledger and Ethereum).

This project includes a Starter Project (Planter AI - CrossPlatform Apps) with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, AWS, (Hyperledger and Ethereum). It will allow developers to create mobile dApps using sensors, A Desktop Image, The App Store, and Google Play using Augmented Reality (AR), AWS (Amazon Web Server & Services) and (Hyperledger & Ethereum).

We plan to release all assets, source code, and notes around February 01, 2023. We are also looking for early adopters, software developers, and entrepreneurs to join the project and help us develop the future of sensor-driven dApps.
