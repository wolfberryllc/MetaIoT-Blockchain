# MetaIoT-Blockchain

MetaIoT-Blockchain is an upcoming project that helps developers prototype and publish sensor-driven (dApps) in augmented reality using React Native, ARKit, Azure, (Hyperledger and Ethereum).

This project includes a Starter Project (Planter AI - CrossPlatform Apps) with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Azure, React Native, ARKit, (Hyperledger and Ethereum). This project allows developers to create mobile dApps using sensors, Snapcraft.io, The App Store, and Google Play.

We plan to release all assets, source code, and notes around April 15, 2023. We are also looking for early adopters, software developers, and entrepreneurs to join the project and help us develop the future of sensor-driven dApps.
